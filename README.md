Pre config steps - 
Run "node . config" or "dict config"  and set the api key. This is a one time configuration step to set your api key.

To use from anywhere run <strong>sudo npm link</strong> from root directory.


## commands available
```bash
$ dict help
$ dict version
$ dict config
$ dict defn <word>
$ dict ex <word>
$ dict syn <word>
$ dict ant <word>
$ dict <word>
$ dict 
$ dict play
```

If you want to run just from the root directory wihtout running npm link use "node . <commands>" instead of "dict <commands>".
